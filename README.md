# User Guide
- Functions marked with the ðŸ”‘ symbol require an API key to be set on the server side and the client side to match for proper use.
- After enabling progress synchronization, the server's reading progress will overwrite the local one.
- Local favorites are stored independently based on the server address, so there's no need to worry about data loss when switching servers.
